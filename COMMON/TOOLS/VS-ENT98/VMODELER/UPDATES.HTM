<center><h1> Known Problems and Limitations<br>
of Visual Modeler 2.0
 </h1></center>
</a><a name="445443">
<p>The following is a list of known problems and limitations in Visual Modeler 2.0.
The number preceding each item is a bug tracking identifier. Please refer to this
number if you have a support question about the problem.
</p>
</a><a name="454567">
<h4> 110167	Problems nesting a logical package within itself
</h4>
</a><a name="454579">
<p>Create a logical package <code><b>cat</b></code>, then open <code><b>cat</b></code>'s principal diagram and 
place another view of <code><b>cat</b></code> there. Copying <code><b>cat</b></code> causes it to get the 
"no model item" adornment.
</p>
</a><a name="456454">
<h4> 110330, 115594<br>
Carriage returns or spaces in icon names can cause 
problems
</h4>
</a><a name="456455">
<p>If an icon name spans multiple lines (that is, contains a 
carriage return) only the last line of the name is visible in the 
icon's specification.
</p>
</a><a name="456456">
<p>Workaround: Use the text box on the icon to view the entire 
name. Better yet, avoid using carriage returns or spaces in icon 
names.
</p>
</a><a name="467751">
<h4> 111040, 115707<br>
Problems with unnamed model items
</h4>
</a><a name="467950">
<p>For example, update cannot resolve unnamed model items.
</p>
</a><a name="467752">
<p>Workaround: Be sure to name all items in the model. (Naming 
relationships is not required.)
</p>
</a><a name="497000">
<p>Assume that you have classes in your model that have 
method arguments of class X. If you go into class X and 
change its name to Y, the arguments are not updated; they 
remain of class X, not class Y.
</p>
</a><a name="467906">
<h4> 115002	Some menu items not gray when they should be in read-
only diagrams
</h4>
</a><a name="478813">
<p>For example, <kbd><b>Change Into</b></kbd> is not grayed out on the <kbd><b>Edit</b></kbd> menu even 
when all the items on the <kbd><b>Change Into</b></kbd> submenu are grayed out.
</p>
</a><a name="480459">
<p>Workaround: Can usually be fixed up by dragging the substate 
out and then back in.
</p>
</a><a name="467881">
<h4> 115773	Query &gt; Expand Classes does not always filter relationships 
correctly
</h4>
</a><a name="467952">
<h4> 115955	Compartment items lost toggling Show Operation 
Signature
</h4>
</a><a name="467883">
<p>If <code><b>Show Method Signature</b></code> is set to ON for a given model, 
but set to OFF in the current Visual Modeler session, the operation will 
not be shown when the model is read in.
</p>
</a><a name="467889">
<p>Workaround: The setting for <code><b>Show Method Signature</b></code> 
should be chosen ONCE for all users who are sharing models 
and NOT be changed.
</p>
</a><a name="501803">
<h4> 120272	Double click on generalization arrow head does not raise 
property sheet
</h4>
</a><a name="498823">
<p>To select or raise the property sheet for an generalization 
relationship, place your cursor on the relationship line rather 
than the arrow head.
</p>
</a><a name="499102">
<p>You can redisplay the windows by pressing <kbd><b>F2</b></kbd> or by minimizing 
and maximizing Visual Modeler.
</p>
</a><a name="499093">
<h4> 121024	Visual Modeler crashes when some background programs are running
</h4>
</a><a name="498857">
<p>Visual Modeler  crashes sporadically when some utility programs are 
running in the background. After Dark is such a utility; the 
mouse-utility Point32 is another.
</p>
</a><a name="499044">
<h4> 121627	Pressing the Cancel button while printing may not have 
any effect
</h4>
</a><a name="499069">
<p>If the <kbd><b>Cancel</b></kbd> button in the Cancel Printing dialog box does not 
work (after you do a <kbd><b>Print Specifications</b></kbd> or <kbd><b>Print Diagrams</b></kbd>), press the 
escape key to force a cancel.   The reason the <kbd><b>Cancel</b></kbd> button does 
not work is usually because of insufficient disk space or not 
enough free memory.
</p>
</a><a name="499120">
<h4> 121877	OLE linking only pastes what is visible in the window
</h4>
</a><a name="498960">
<p>To see the entire diagram in another application, choose <kbd><b>View</b></kbd> &gt; 
<kbd><b>Fit in Window</b></kbd> in Visual Modeler before you copy and paste into the other 
application.
</p>
</a><a name="498957">
<h4> 121919	Copy and paste into PowerPoint with "visibility as icons" 
does not work correctly
</h4>
</a><a name="498946">
<p>If you encounter this problem, restart PowerPoint and 
copy/paste again with "visibility as icons" off.
</p>
</a><a name="498911">
<h4> 121945	Loading Visual Modeler models by choosing them in Windows 
Explorer can cause crash
</h4>
</a><a name="499178">
<p>Because the Setup wizard does not completely register Visual Modeler 
with Windows, if you attempt to start Visual Modeler the first time by 
double clicking a model in Windows Explorer, Visual Modeler may crash. 
After Visual Modeler has been run once, the registration is complete and 
double clicking model files will work correctly.
</p>
</a><a name="499259">
<h4> 121976	Adding methods and properties to classes can cause them 
to be erroneously resized
</h4>
</a><a name="498892">
<p>If a class icon is incorrectly resized after a method or 
a property is added, you can select the class and use the mouse 
to resize it.
</p>
</a><a name="498975">
<h4> 121980	Context-sensitive help doesn't work for some menus
</h4>
</a><a name="499341">
<h4> 122048	Label buttons
</h4>
</a><a name="499344">
<p>Visual Modeler does not support label buttons, but there may still be 
references to label buttons in pictures of screens in the 
documentation.
</p>
</a><a name="501675">
<h4> 122230, 122231, 122232<br>
Problems with "What's This?" help
</h4>
</a><a name="501676">
<p>There are several problems with "What's This?" in the online 
help:
</p>
</a><ul><a name="501678">
<li>You may encounter the following message when using 
"What's This?" help:

</a><a name="501685">
<p><code><b>No Help Topic is associated with this item.
</b></code></p>
</a><a name="501687">
<p>This does not necessarily imply that there is no help 
available for the item. Often the "What's This?" help 
mechanism for the item simply has not been connected. 
Click on the <kbd><b>Help</b></kbd> button in the dialog box and you will be 
able to traverse to the information you need.
</p>
</a><a name="501680">
<li>In some cases, "What's This?" help will display a large 
screen of information that is clipped at the bottom. If the 
information you are interested in is not displayed, click on 
the <kbd><b>Help</b></kbd> button in the dialog box and you will be able to 
traverse to the information you need.
</p>
</a><a name="501709">
<li>There are pop-up links in some "What's This?" help topics, 
but you cannot traverse to the associated pop-up windows 
with "What's This?" help. As is normal with "What's This?" 
help topics, as soon as you click the mouse once, the help 
topic goes away. To follow a pop-up link that is displayed, 
click on the dialog box's <kbd><b>Help</b></kbd> button and then you will be 
able to traverse to the pop-up window.

</a></ul><a name="501785">
<p>In short, when you are in a Visual Modeler dialog box and "What's This?" 
help (or the <kbd><b>?</b></kbd> in the window banner) does not help you, try the 
<kbd><b>Help</b></kbd> button instead.
</p>
</a></ul><a name="505275">
<h4> 122339	Separate name spaces not supported
</h4>
</a><a name="505277">
<p>UML packages are
intended to be unique name spaces. However, Visual Modeler does not 
support separate name spaces; names must be unique 
throughout the entire model. So, for example, in models:
</p>
</a><ul><a name="505291">
<li>A logical package and a class cannot have the same name.

</a><a name="505293">
<li>Two different classes, in two different packages, cannot 
have the same simple name.

</a></ul>
<h4> 123352	Visual Modeler Add-Ins require a single running Visual Basic 5
</h4>
</a>
<p>The Visual Modeler Add-Ins can operate only if a single Visual Basic 5
application is running. If multiple Visual Basic 5 applications are running,
the code generation and reverse engineering tools in Visual Modeler
cannot be used.

</a></ul>
<h4> 123522	Component view not used for code generation
</h4>
</a>
<p>No code is generated for model items in the Component view, that is, for
EXEs and DLLs.

</a></ul>
<h4> 123716	Documentation not saved when exporting to repository
</h4>
</a>
<p>When exporting a model to the repository, the documentation is not saved.

</a></ul>
<h4> 124217	Creatable Option for classes
</h4>
</a>
<p>The Creatable code generation option for classes does not use the correct
Visual Basic 5 naming. The Creatable option values in Visual Modeler correspond 
to the following instancing properties in Visual Basic 5: OnNewProcess = 3-SingleUse, 
GlobalOnNewProcess = 4-GlobalSingleUse, InSameProcess = 5-MultiUse, 
GlobalInSameProcess = 6-GlobalMultiUse.

</a></ul>
<h4> 124251	Visual Modeler Add-Ins Menus makes Visual Basic 5 crash on exit
</h4>
</a>
<p>The Visual Modeler Add-In Menus may, under some
circumstances, cause Visual Basic 5 to crash when quitting the application.
This problem occurs if the Visual Modeler Add-In Menus is running in the add-in manager
together with either &quot;VB Add-In Toolbar&quot; or &quot;Source Code Control&quot;. Please
refer to the Microsoft Knowledge Base, article ID Q167213, for explanation
and workarounds.

<center><h2> Additional Information
 </h2></center>

</a></ul>
<h4> 	Registration problems
</h4>
</a>
<p>In some configurations the installation program may have problems
registering the DLLs used by Visual Modeler. If, for example, the <kbd><b>Tools>
Class Wizard</b></kbd> command fails to execute, run the <CODE><B>REGRVB.BAT</B></CODE> program from the
folder in which Visual Modeler is installed.

</a></ul>
<h4> 	DAO 3.5 Object Library Needed in OrderSys Example
</h4>
</a>
<p>The order system example, located in the <CODE><B>\Samples\Ordersystem</B></CODE> folder, needs
the Microsoft DAO 3.5 object library. Your Visual Basic 5 product may be
installed without this component. If the DAO library is missing, you can add
it in the following way: 
</p>
</a><ol>
<a name="492028">
<li>Run the Visual Basic installation program and select a Custom installation.
</a><a name="492029">
<li>Select the Data Access option in the displayed dialog box.

</a></ul>
<h4> 	Full ActiveX Interface Names
</h4>
</a>
<p>Visual Modeler supports only one name space; a class name must be unique within a
model. In OLE, an ActiveX component constitutes its own name space. Thus, two ActiveX
components can export the same interface name. You can instruct the
Visual Modeler reverse engineering tool to create unique class names by
combining the ActiveX name and the class name, for example: DAO.Database.
The default behavior of Visual Modeler is to use short ActiveX names. To
use long ActiveX names, change LongActiveXNames to Yes in your <CODE><B>rose.ini</B></CODE>
file, which is found in the Windows folder.

</a></ul>
<h4> 	Deletion of Component Members in Visual Basic 5
</h4>
</a>
<p>Visual Modeler synchronizes your Visual Basic project and model
during code generation and reverse engineering by removing deleted members.
The default behavior in Visual Modeler is to remove members by commenting
the code. To turn this off and have the tool completely remove the members from
the code, set CommentMethods to No in your <CODE><B>rose.ini</B></CODE> file, which is found in
the Windows folder.

</a></ul>
<h4> 	Deletion of Collection Classes in Visual Modeler
</h4>
</a>
<p>User-defined collection classes can be automatically created in Visual Modeler by changing the CollectionClass option for a class. To delete a
created collection class from the model:
</p>
</a><ol>
<a name="492030">
<li>Select the collection class in the browser and choose <kbd><b>Edit> Delete from Model</b></kbd>.
</a><a name="492031">
<li>Reset the CollectionClass option on the item class to Collection.

</a></ul>
<h4> 	Online Help Find Tab
</h4>
</a>
<p>If you choose to build a Find database of a subset of the available help
files using the &quot;Customize search capabilities&quot; alternative, you may get the
error message &quot;Unable to display the Find tab&quot;, or the resulting database
may contain words from help files other than the selected files.
