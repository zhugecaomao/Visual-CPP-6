---- Documentation ----

InstallShield includes a Help Library covering all aspects of InstallShield
and its use. The entire Help Library and its books are accessible from the
Help  menu in the InstallShield IDE.

Help Library topics are also accessible from the IDE by pressing F1 or
clicking Help, when available. You can instantly access InstallScript
help from the Script Editor by placing your cursor in an InstallScript
keyword, function name, or other identifier and pressing F1.


Help Library

To open the entire Help Library, select Help Library from the Help 
menu. Opening the Help Library in this manner provides standard WinHelp
Contents, Index, and Find tabs covering all help books in the library.

The InstallShield Help Library is composed of three top-level books,
described below. To open an individual book, select the book name from
the Help  menu in InstallShield. When you open a Help Library book
in this manner, you get Contents, Index, and Find tabs covering that book
only. You still have access to the entire Help Library via hypertext links,
of course.


Getting Started

Shows you how to start producing real setups now. Getting Started explains
the building blocks of setups and provides tutorials in setup creation.
It also contains information on migrating from InstallShield3 to InstallShield5.1.


Getting Results

Covers all aspects of setups and their creation by telling you about and
telling you how. Getting Results also includes reference guides to the
InstallShield IDE, the InstallShield Visual Debugger, and the Script Editor.


InstallScript Language Reference

Documents the structure, elements, syntax, and functions of the
InstallScript language. Includes example scripts you can copy and paste
into the Script Editor for easy implementation into your setups.


Function Wizard

The InstallShield Function Wizard is a unique blend of functionality and
documentation. The Function Wizard lets you choose any of the nearly
300 functions provided with InstallShield, helps you enter the parameters,
and then inserts your function call into your script. The Function Wizard's
Help button provides instant access to detailed function descriptions in the
Language Reference. You can launch the Function Wizard from the right click
menu in the Script Editor window, or from the toolbar (the third button from
the right).


InstallShield Visual C++ Wizard

InstallShield for Microsoft Visual C++ 6 includes the InstallShield 
Visual C++ Wizard. With this wizard you can quickly create a runnable 
InstallShield setup project that installs your application and properly handles 
any file dependencies.

If you installed InstallShield before installing Microsoft Visual C++ 6, 
you will see a warning message about the InstallShield Visual C++ Wizard 
not being placed on Visual C++'s Tools menu. If you proceed with the installation, 
you can manually add the InstallShield Visual C++ Wizard to Visual C++'s Tools menu 
later by doing the following:

1. On the Tools menu, click Customize, and then click the Tools tab.

2. In the Menu Contents box, scroll to the bottom of the list, double-click 
   the blank line (indicated by an empty rectangle), type "InstallShield 
   Wizard", and press Enter. 

3. In the Menu Contents box, highlight the name you just entered.

4. In the Command box browse or type the path and name of the wizard 
   executable file ISVCwiz.exe. The file is in the Program subfolder 
   of the InstallShield for Microsoft Visual C++ 6 folder. 


Known Problems and Limitations

Please make sure you are running the M3 Alpha release of Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0. 
The version of MFC42.DLL shipped with M2 Alpha version of Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 
has a problem while trying to bring up property sheets on systems. This has been 
tested on both Win 95 and Win NT 4.0. The M3 Alpha version of Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 
fixes this problem.
